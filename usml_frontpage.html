    <h1>Under Sea Modeling Library (USML)</h1>
    <p>
      The Under Sea Modeling Library (USML) is a collection of C++ software
      development modules for sonar modeling and simulation.
      The Wavefront Queue 3D (WaveQ3D) model is the component of USML
      that computes acoustic transmission loss in the ocean using
      Hybrid Gaussian Beams in Spherical/Time Coordinates.
      At this time, most of the other modules provide support to WaveQ3D.

    <h3>Configuration Issues with External Dependencies</h3>
    <p>This version of USML requires a few changes to the external dependencies.</p> 
    <ul>
    <li> By default, CMake does not include a module to find NetCDF libraries.  Please copy the 
         <code>FindNetCDF.cmake</code> file from the <code>config</code> directory 
         into CMake's shared modules directory. </li>
    <li> Unidata's recent refactoring of the NetCDF library (Summer of 2010) hopelessly broke
         the existing port to Microsoft Visual Studio (see 
         <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/faq.html#windows_netcdf4_1">
         http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/faq.html#windows_netcdf4_1</a>).
         Until this is fixed by the open source community, Windows developers are expected 
         to create their own NetCDF libraries from source code.  A copy of the 
         CMake-based build that system that we used for testing is freely available on GitHub at
         <a href="https://github.com/campreilly/netcdf-4.1.3-with-cmake">
	 https://github.com/campreilly/netcdf-4.1.3-with-cmake</a>.
    <li> There is a bug in version 1.48 of the Boost uBLAS library that prevents us from overloading
         operator/().  To see the correctedd version of this code, please search for the 
         symbol BOOST_UBLAS_CHECK_DIVISION_TYPE in the <code>vector_expression.hpp</code> 
         and <code>matrix_expression.hpp</code> files in the <code>config</code> directory.
         In each case, the operator/() should be using the enable_if<> macros just like the operator*() 
         just above it. Those using Boost 1.48.0 can just replace the original files with the
         ones from the <code>config</code> directory.
    </ul>

    <h2>Building and Testing USML</h2>

    <p>
      For the sake of the example, let's assume that you are installing on a Linux
      system into the "~/Projects/usml" directory. Assuming that this is the current
      directory, and that all of the tarballs are here as well, the Linux commands
      to execute would be:
      <pre>
        tar -xzf usml-src-#.##.tar.gz
        tar -xzf usml-doc-#.##.tar.gz
        tar -xzf usml-data-#.##.tar.gz
      </pre>
      where #.## is the version number to be installed.
    </p><p>
      This library is built using the CMake cross-platform, open-source build system.
      Users are strongly encouraged to configure their builds using the cmake-gui
      tool.  CMake makes it much easier to support cross-platform builds, but it
      requires a few more steps than a direct Makefile interface.
      For example, a simple Unix build includes the following steps.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the cmake-gui tool, set the source directory to the place where you
        installed the USML source code.
      </li>
      <li>
        Setup for an "out of source" build by setting the binary directory to
        something like the "~/Projects/usml-build" directory.  Using a binary
        directory that is not outside of the source tree is strictly optional,
        except for the <a href="http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/Eclipse_CDT4_Generator">
	Eclipse CMake generator</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the "Configure" button to process the CMakeList file.
        Select the "Unix Makefile" generator from the pop-up menu.
      </li>
      <li>
        Change any options that you'd like. Note that the USML_PEDANTIC option
        is only used to search for questionable programming during our development.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hit the "Configure" button a second time, even if you have not changed any
        options.  Hit the "Generate" button to create makefiles for your system.
        At this point, you can close the cmake-gui tool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Run the "make" utility from "~/Projects/usml-build" directory to compile both
        the usml shared libraries and the usml_test regression tests.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can optionally use "make install" to install the compiled programs into
        the include, lib, and src directories in /usr/local.
      </li>
      <li>
        Running the "usml_test"  regression test should run without errors if the
        compilation and install were successful.  Prints "*** No errors detected".
      </li>
    </ul>
