This study was conducted as a class project for OCE 673 Advanced 
Acoustic Propagation at the University of Rhode Island.

Several papers have recently focused on the presence of strong 
3-D propagation effects in experimental data on the continental 
shelf in the Florida Straits area.  During a 1999 experiment to 
estimate sediment properties from an acoustic inversion 
at this site, Jiang et. al. concluded that their experiment 
was strongly influenced by secondary signals that originated 
from horizontal refraction effects. The Calibration Operations 
(CALOPS) experiment found similar effects in this area in the 
late summer (September 7–15) of 2007 and in the winter 
(February 19–25) of 2008.  In this study, the CALOPS experimental 
results that were previously studied by Heaney, Ballard, et. al. 
will be used to test the accuracy of the Wavefront Queue 3-D 
(WaveQ3D) model.
